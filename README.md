# NatureBuddy
## A Social Feed Platform for Encouraging Community Collaboration for Improving the Current Environmental Situation 

### Project Description

The environment is continuously degrading at an alarming rate. This brought a catastrophic impact on the lives of people, communities and countries. Environmental degradation can be attributed to deforestation, war and overpopulation which leads to overconsumption. Burning fossil fuels such as oil, gas and coal are also some of the causes of industry activity that contributes to pollution. When burnt fossil fuel releases carbon dioxide, it goes into the atmosphere causing the planet to heat up. It results in global warming which also results in climate change.


In the coming decades, scientists expect the global temperature to rise and this will alter the geographic changes of many types of plants and animals. Water ecosystems will also change as the sea-surface will continue to warm. Other future impacts of climate change include rise in sea level, changing rainfall patterns and melting of glaciers. 

As long as people continue to increase the amount of heat-trapping greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, all of these changes will occur. Everyone is affected by climate change, but the most affected are the children, those in poverty, and the future generations. By destroying nature and altering the climate, these challenges contribute to environmental issues that pose a threat to life on land, in the sea, and in the air.  While the government and industries should take bigger roles and responsibilities for creating difference in solving the issue of environmental degradation, everyone is also responsible and can make an impact through any means in helping the environment. 

Volunteerism is a powerful mechanism that opens up pathways for greater participation of people in environmental sustainability. Any reason that motivates an individual to volunteer especially for improving the condition of the environment is worthwhile. The desire to help the causes they believe in or feel passionate about are some of the main reasons. These actions bring a positive impact for themselves and the environment. 
	
 A mobile application that will allow people to share their actions and ideas in helping the environment will be developed. It provides users a feature for supporting volunteers by donating funds. It also allows any user to initiate a project that can help the environment which the other users can join to. The initiator of the project will provide the information such as date location of the project and relevant information, then those who joined will be informed. 
        
        
A platform such as NatureBuddy will help people to bring a small but significant impact on the improvement of the current environmental situation. People can contribute ideas and funds, and encourage collaboration to solve environmental problems in the community  through this app. They can also post current problems and proposed solutions that other people can support.
